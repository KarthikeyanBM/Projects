# Projects

Vacuum cleaner robot - Vaccum cleaner robot is a modified
form of obstacle detection robot. Where the robot was
automated and move around the floor automatically and clean
the surface with the help of vaccum and by detecting the
obstacle it can alter the direction automatically.

Smart Weather monitoring system - The proposed system
functions with tracking and monitoring environmental
circumstances such as temperature, relative humidity, light
intensity, pressure and quantity of rainfall with sensors and it will
accessed through cloud platform through Wi-Fi and also with
mobile

Wireless Electronic notice board - Its basically used in various
applications as we can provide the information on the notice
board systematically as well as we can provide an alert to the
users through SMS and phone wirelessly through GSM

Heart disease prediction in pregnant women with diabetes using ML - For diabetic pregnant women, heart disease tends to possess serious danger since it raises the possibility of unfavorable maternal and foetal outcomes. Finding diabetic expectant mothers who are at a high risk of heart disease can help with early treatments and better results. In a variety of patient demographics, machine learning algorithms have  showed promise in the prediction of cardiac disease. Our goal in this project is to create a machine learning-based prognostic model for heart disease in diabetic pregnant women. For the purpose of identifying pertinent risk factors, we will examine clinical data from electronic health records, including demographic data, medical history, test results, and medication history. In order to forecast cardiac illness, we will compare how well several machine learning techniques, such as support vector machines, decision trees, and random forests, perform. Our research will shed light on the viability of utilising machine learning algorithms to anticipate cardiac problems in diabetic pregnant women, which may enhance mother and foetal outcomes.
